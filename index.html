      <p class="container2">The Asian giant hornet, commonly dubbed the "murder hornet," is a huge hornet that can be as
        large as over two
        inches long, according to the US Department of Agriculture. These deadly creatures can mass murder honeybees and
        have led to human fatalities. Up to 50 people a year in Japan die from the murder hornets, according to the New
        York Times. These hornets were first sighted in the US this past December in Washington.</p>

    <h1 class="lower">Current Inspiration: Orchards</h1>
    <p class="moveright">An orchard is an intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards
      comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also
      sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose.[1] A fruit
      garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may
      emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid,
      with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy.</p>
